> each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.

### Input Description

Let the user enter the length of the array followed by n x n numbers.
Fill an array from left to right starting from above.

### Output Description

If it is a Latin square, then display true. Else, display false.

I did not do the bonus:

> A Latin square is said to be reduced if both its first row
> and its first column are in their natural order.
> You can reduce a Latin square by reordering the rows and columns...
> Reduce \[the Latin Square\] and display it.
